# ML System Design Collection

A comprehensive collection of machine learning system design case studies and implementations focused on real-world, large-scale applications.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide detailed ML system design examples that demonstrate:
- Architectural considerations for large-scale ML systems
- Practical implementation patterns and best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Monitoring and maintenance strategies
- Interview preparation materials

## System Design Examples

### [Instagram Explore Recommendation System](instagram-explore/)
A large-scale recommendation system handling:
- Billions of items and millions of users
- Real-time personalization
- Complex ranking and retrieval challenges
- Multi-modal content processing
- Comprehensive monitoring and evaluation
